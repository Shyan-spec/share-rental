# SHARE. 

#  Rental Website

## Project Description 

Share. is an innovative web-based platform designed to revolutionize the way people access and share everyday items. Our goal is to create a community-driven space where users can both find items they need for temporary use and list their own items for others to rent. This project is centered around the concept of a shared economy, reducing waste and promoting sustainability.
